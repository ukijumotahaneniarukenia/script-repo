BASH Auto-completion
====================

The datamash package inclueds a bash auto-completion script.
The installation location can be controlled using

    ./configure --with-bash-completion-dir=[no|local|global|PATH]

The options are:

* local  - install under the package's $PREFIX path.
           typically `/usr/local/share/datamash/bash-completion.d/` ,
           but can be changed with `./configure --prefix`.
           This is the default.

* no     - do not install the bash completion script.

* [PATH] - install into the PATH specified on the command line, e.g.
           `./configure --with-bash-completion-dir=/for/bar/bash-completion.d/`

* global - install into the system's global bash-completion directory,
           as reported by `pkg-config`. This will be the result of:
           `pkg-config --variable=completionsdir bash-completion`
           Which is commonly `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions`
           or `/etc/bash.d`.
           If `pkg-config` is not found or if `pkg-config` does not have
           the config (.pc) file for the bash-completion package,
           defaults to 'local'.

`local` is the default, and should be used particularly if installing under
a non-default `--prefix` without root permissions.
`global` should be used if you are installing to default location (/usr/local)
and have root permissions (e.g. `sudo make install`).
Using custom PATH or `global` should be used when packaging datamash for
further distribution.
